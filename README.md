# Getting Started

To run this application we recommend MySQL and Ruby > 1.8.6 (1.8.7, 1.9.2-p290). Please note the application has not been tested against versions of Ruby later than 1.9.2-p290. This guide assumes that you have RVM installed to manage your Rubies.

## RVM

If you don't already have it then go ahead and grab Ruby 1.9.2:

```bash
rvm install ruby-1.9.2-p290
```
